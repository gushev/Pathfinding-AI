# Pathfinding-AI
A simple AI that finds a path in a randomly generated 2d matrix. Every aspect of the layout is customisable: size, starting point, ending point and number of obstacles. All of the objects on the matrix can also have random coordinates, which sometimes lead to very interesting scenarios.

# Changing parameters
Inside Main.java you will see the creation of a new 2d matrix (the Board). It has a number of modifiable paramenters: the height, width and number of randomly placed obstacles.

By default the Start and End points in the maze are placed randomly, as well as the obstacles, but you can change that through the Board.java file (I've left a bit of commented code that will give you an idea to how it works).
